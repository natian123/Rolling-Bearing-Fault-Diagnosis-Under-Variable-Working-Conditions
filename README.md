# Rolling-Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis-Under-Variable-Working-Conditions
#This repository is for the transfer learning or domain adaptive with fault diagnosis.

It should be notice that we use the PyTorch 1.9, python 3.7. If one use the lastest PyTorch and python, there will be some errors.
The paper is as follow:
RAAN A Gaussian prior domain adaptive network for rolling bearing fault diagnosis under variable working conditions 

Adversarial domain-adapted bearing fault diagnosis based on ResNet and LIMMD（Not yet retrieved）

There are two types of datasets involved in this project, one is the public dataset: CWRU bearing fault dataset（ https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter ）
The second is our self collected dataset of centrifugal pump bearings, which comes from real industrial scenarios (please contact us if applicable)
